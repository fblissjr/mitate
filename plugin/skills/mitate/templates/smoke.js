/* ---------- THE one way to read scene pixels in-page ------------------------
   Renders at `ts` and hands the canvas to `reader` inside a SINGLE evaluate —
   one JS task. This is structural, not stylistic: the node stack clears the
   drawing buffer after compositing, so a read in a LATER task intermittently
   sees zeros (or a stale canvas mid-resize). Three checks independently
   reinvented this race before the helper existed — exposure ("crushed 100%"
   on a known-good scene), the framing grid (MAD 84 on a correct scene), and a
   canvas-change prototype (all-zero hashes read as "deterministic"). A new
   pixel check goes through sampleAt or it is wrong by default.

/* ---------- the sampling layer ----------------------------------------------
   Every check in this file used to hand-roll its own sampling, which is why the
   SAME defect kept appearing independently: the determinism check, the blank
   check, the contact sheet and (until it was re-bracketed) the framing lint each
   picked their own point and then reported about the whole film.

   The proof that this matters, measured on one scene with three controls: a
   provably non-deterministic scene reported `all scenes pass, 0 warnings`,
   because `t = Math.min(1, dur/3)` is the CONSTANT 1.0s for any film over 3s —
   inside the title card the workflow tells you to write first — and t=1.0 was
   the only timestamp in that film where the scene was clean.

   So sampling becomes shared infrastructure rather than a habit. A check states
   a plan, gets points that respect what the harness already knows (duration,
   beats, flash windows), and REPORTS WHICH POINTS IT USED — a green result
   should be auditable, not authoritative.

   avoid:'flash' matters more than it looks: CONFIG.flashes peaks at beat edges,
   so any fixed fraction lands inside the white-out on exactly the beats that
   bracket a world cut — the highest-risk moments in a two-world film. */

  // Interior points only: t=0 and t=DURATION are edges, and t=0 is a title card
  // in essentially every scene this skill produces -- which is how the old
  // single-sample check came to look at the one moment a broken scene was clean.
  //
  // Flash avoidance is done against MERGED intervals, not one flash at a time.
  // The first version walked the flash list mutating t in place, so a sample
  // nudged clear of one flash could land inside the next: measured, two flashes
  // 0.4s apart (an ordinary cut-in/cut-out pair) put a sample at 95% white --
  // reintroducing the exact failure the sampler exists to prevent. It also made
  // the plan depend on the order the author happened to list CONFIG.flashes.
  // Each flash reports its OWN half-width now (CONFIG.flashWidth / per-flash w),
