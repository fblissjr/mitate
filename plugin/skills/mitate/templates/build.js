   (.sheetframes, .motionframes, .stripframes, .aspectframes, .loopsrc,
   .loopframes, .avifsrc, .avifframes) and rmSync it at entry AND in finally.
   Five independent agents hit the consequence: two commands in one directory
   silently corrupt each other. Measured worst case, two concurrent `frames`
   runs produced a single dir holding 3 frames from one film and 70 from
   another — 73 where one film alone needs 74 — and the next encode would have
   shipped that chimera without a word.

   Suffixing each of the six names with a pid would be the bandaid, and it is
   the wrong shape: the seventh command someone adds will hardcode a seventh
   name. So there is one function, and it is the only way to get scratch space.

// 15.16MB (reproducing the number above), mp4 0.68MB, AVIF 0.28MB. On the

// keyframe-plus-deltas stream, so it inter-frame compresses the way the mp4 does
// instead of collapsing like WebP. But that same AV1 sequence is decoded in
// software at playback (no hardware video path), so it costs decode CPU and was

// picture: an animated AVIF is an AV1 still-image sequence, decoded in software
// frame by frame with no hardware video path, so it costs decode CPU at playback
// and was observed to stutter on modest hardware (worse in macOS Preview than
// Chrome). loop() (WebP) trades that away -- larger on disk, but smooth to play
// and verified rendering inline. Peer options, chosen by camera style and
// audience hardware, not a ranking. The -s knob below is encode-time only; it
// cannot make an AVIF cheaper to PLAY.
//
// -s 6 is the measured knee on encoder speed: s8 produced files 2.3x larger for
// one second less, s4 gave no further size gain for double the time. Encoding
// 288 frames costs ~11s, negligible against the ~65s it takes to shoot them.
// -q 60 matches what `loop` passes img2webp; decoded frames were inspected and
// hold up (crisp overlay text, smooth gradients, SSIM 0.97 against source).
//
// Verifying the output is animated: use `avifdec --info <file>`, which prints
// "N frames" and the repeat count. Do NOT use ffprobe -- it reports an animated
// AVIF as a single frame, which reads exactly like "avifenc silently wrote a
// still" and would send you rewriting a working encoder. Cross-check by size if
// unsure: one 960px still of this scene is 7.3KB against 290KB for the 288-frame
// sequence, so a sequence that collapsed to a still is off by a factor of 40.
// Shared scaffolding for the two animated inline exports — avif() and loop()
// differ only in encoder and warning text, and their setup had already drifted
// apart once before this extraction. Shape, and why each piece:
//   - own workspace pair, never frames/: `loop` once reused frames/ and
//     silently destroyed the full-resolution masters a previous `build.js all`
//     had shot;
//   - encoder probed BEFORE the shoot: the missing-binary failure used to
//     surface only after the full multi-second shoot had already run;
//   - explicit file list rather than a shell glob: not for ARG_MAX (execFileSync
//     argv hits the same execve limit) but for deterministic ordering and a
//     loud failure when scaling produced nothing;
//   - clean in finally: a failed run used to leave scratch dirs full of frames
