# The node stack: WebGPURenderer, TSL, and the recorder

The renderer-specific half of mitate's 3D backend. The universal method —
failure axes, beats discipline, determinism rules — is `method.md`; the shot
vocabulary is `film-language.md`. This file is what changed when the stack
moved from `WebGLRenderer` + GLSL to `WebGPURenderer` + TSL, and every claim in
it was measured on `three@0.185.1` during Phase 0 (2026-07-23).

## One renderer, two backends

`WebGPURenderer` resolves its backend at `init()`: a WebGPU adapter if the
browser offers one, else a transparent WebGL2 fallback — same scene code, same
TSL materials, visually identical composition (measured). Frames are NOT
byte-identical across backends, so byte-wise regressions must pin the backend
on both sides. The scene exports which backend actually ran as
`window.BACKEND` (`'webgpu' | 'webgl2'`), because the answer depends on both
launch flags and the Chromium build, and inferring it goes wrong.

The recorder's policy (`shoot.js` / `smoke.js`, same logic):

| Env | Effect |
|---|---|
| (nothing) | No WebGPU flags. Headless usually has no adapter; WebGL2 fallback. The universal, CI-safe default. |
| `WEBGPU=metal` | macOS hardware adapter (`--enable-unsafe-webgpu --use-angle=metal`). Verified. ~2.3x faster end to end (37 vs 87 ms/frame with post chain, screenshots included). |
| `WEBGPU=vulkan` | Linux hardware adapter. UNVERIFIED here; run smoke first. |
| `WEBGPU=auto` | metal on darwin, vulkan elsewhere. |
| `WEBGPU=swiftshader` | Software WebGPU. Diagnostic-only: ships flat frames on the playwright headless-shell build, warmth-dependently on others. `shoot.js` refuses it without `WEBGPU_UNSAFE_SHIP=1`; smoke's shipped-frame check exists exactly for it. |
| `ANGLE_BACKEND=...` | GL backend selection for the fallback path, unchanged from the old stack. Conflicts with `WEBGPU=` are rejected loudly. |

**The landmine that motivated all of this:** on macOS, `--enable-unsafe-webgpu`
WITHOUT `--use-angle=metal` hands Chromium a SwiftShader-WebGPU adapter whose
compositor ships the flat clear color — every frame, exit 0, deterministic,
captions crisp on top. Four instruments passed on it before the shipped-frame
check existed. Never hand-roll WebGPU flags; go through the env policy.

## The async boot contract

```js
await renderer.init();                       // resolves the backend
await renderer.compileAsync(scene, camera);  // pre-warms every material
window.BACKEND = renderer.backend.isWebGPUBackend ? 'webgpu' : 'webgl2';
window.seekTo(0);
window.sceneReady = true;                    // ONLY now may the recorder capture
```

`renderAsync()` is deprecated in r185; after boot, the synchronous
`renderer.render()` inside `seekTo` is the verified path on both backends.
One WebGPU-backend caution from the minimal-repro work: the very FIRST
render of a scene can differ one-time from every later render of the same
state even with sorting off (a warmup signature, distinct from the revisit
bug). The boot's `seekTo(0)` before `sceneReady` absorbs it — never
byte-compare against a frame captured before that first render completes.

## The six determinism rules the node stack adds

1. **Time reaches shaders through one uniform.** `const uTime = THREE.uniform(0)`,
   set from `seekTo`. The TSL `time` node auto-increments off a wall clock —
   never import it. A node graph reading uTime is exactly as pure as a
   property set from `t`.
2. **The nodeFrame tick in seekTo is load-bearing.** Shadow maps update at
   most once per `nodeFrame.frameId` (`ShadowNode.updateBefore` — its guard
   overrides even `shadow.needsUpdate`), and frameId only advances in the
   renderer's internal rAF loop, never in `render()`. Two seeks in one browser
   tick would leave the second rendering with the first's shadow map —
   measured as a flaky byte-determinism failure confined to shadowed regions.
   `window.seekTo` therefore calls `renderer._nodes.nodeFrame.update()` before
   rendering. Private API, pinned at 0.185.1; smoke fails loudly if an upgrade
   renames it. Do not remove it because everything looks fine without it —
   everything looked fine without it.
3. **No temporal passes.** TRAA, afterimage, accumulation motion blur carry
   state across frames. The bundled TSL display passes (bloom, dof, film,
   chromaticAberration) are per-frame pure.
4. **No `ComputeNode` / storage buffers.** Stateful across dispatches, and the
   WebGL2 fallback cannot run them at all.
5. **`renderer.sortObjects = false` stays off.** Found by the gearbox
   regression film, then CONFIRMED by a minimal out-of-pipeline
   reproduction (3 meshes, no shadows, no fog, both backends — repro
   scripts preserved in the session scratchpad, candidate for an upstream
   issue): with depth sorting on, REVISITING a state after the sort order
   changed renders objects at the previous render's pose. First visit
   correct; every revisit wrong; 100% deterministic-wrong on revisit (the
   in-pipeline "~12% flaky" was sampling structure, not a race); sticky
   across re-renders and settle time; and the stale object's SHADOW draws
   at the CORRECT pose while its beauty pass lags. Object motion through
   the depth order is a sufficient trigger — camera cuts are just the
   common cause. Control: sortObjects=false was 40/40 clean in the repro
   and 16/16 on the real scene. Consequence: transparent objects draw in
   CREATION order, so when transparent things overlap on screen, create
   the farther one first.
6. **`frustumCulled = false` on every mesh** (the template's `mesh()` helper
   does it). The per-mesh cull decision was measured consuming a stale pose:
   a mesh near the frustum edge rendered or vanished depending on which t the
   camera arrived from. Scenes here are tens of meshes; culling buys nothing.

## Recorder mechanics that differ from the old stack

- **Settle before screenshot.** `render()` queues GPU work; the compositor can
  present it a frame late, so the recorder settles one double-rAF between
  `seekTo` and every screenshot. Measured before the fix: flaky screenshot
  hashes over byte-identical canvas content. Scene contract is unchanged —
  `seekTo` stays synchronous.
- **The drawing buffer is cleared after compositing.** An in-page
  `drawImage(canvas)` readback in a LATER task reads zeros; render-and-read
  must share one `evaluate`. smoke's exposure sampler does this; copy that
  pattern for any new in-page pixel check.
- **smoke's shipped-frame check** opens a caption-stripped page (`?strip=text`)
  cold — before the main check page warms the GPU process — and fails if every
  sampled `t` ships the identical image or if the RICHEST sampled frame's luma
  spread is under `SHIPPED_SPREAD_FLOOR` (bracket: broken 1.7, healthy 3D
  161.3, flat 2D register 120.9). It measures the exact bytes the recorder
  writes, which is the only layer where "it renders" means anything.
- **Chromium resolution matters.** The managed-cache scan includes Apple
  Silicon layouts; without them the tools silently fell through to system
  Chrome — an auto-updating build that disagreed with playwright's pinned one
  about WebGPU. `CHROMIUM_PATH` overrides; keep the gate and the recorder on
  the same binary.

## The gearbox regression twin (measured 2026-07-23)

The same scene body (beats, worlds, shots, animate) injected into this
skill's template and frozen explainer-video's renders near-identically:
composition, lighting, and read match cell for cell on the contact sheets;
both pass their own smoke. The once-reported "~3% framing delta" between
stacks was MEASURED AWAY: at equal viewport and equal t, rendered geometry
is sub-pixel identical (±0.7 px over 14 silhouette probes) across classic
WebGL, the WebGL2 fallback, and WebGPU-Metal — the observed delta was a
capture-viewport mismatch in the original A/B (one screenshot's effective
viewport was ~33 px short; on-screen size is proportional to innerHeight
because the scene fixes vertical fov). Lesson: pin the viewport before
byte- or crop-comparing captures. What genuinely differs across stacks is
SHADING — the node renderer's highlights are brighter and shadows tighter
(~9% of pixels differ by >8/255) — which the eye reads as zoom. Also
learned here: `key.shadow.normalBias = .035` kills shadow acne on extruded
faces at closeup (a scene-rig setting; both stacks needed it). The shipped
example is `examples/gearbox.html` / `examples/gearbox.avif`.

## Node materials in scene code

Everything from `three/webgpu` and `three/tsl` is spread flat onto `THREE` by
the vendor bundle, plus `SkyMesh` and the display passes `bloom`, `dof`,
`film`, `chromaticAberration`. The template's demo material is the pattern:

```js
const mat = new THREE.MeshStandardNodeMaterial({ roughness: .35 });
const veins = THREE.mx_fractal_noise_float(
  THREE.positionLocal.mul(1.6).add(uTime.mul(.25)), 4, 2.0, .5, 1.0).mul(.5).add(.5);
mat.colorNode = THREE.mix(THREE.color(0x2a9d8f), THREE.color(0x8ad5c9), veins.smoothstep(.35, .8));
```

Zero assets: MaterialX noise (`mx_noise_float` — the Perlin-style one; there
is NO `mx_perlin_noise_float` export and a typo'd node name propagates as
`undefined` silently — plus `mx_worley_noise_float`, `mx_fractal_noise_float`,
`mx_aastep`) computes on the GPU. `MeshPhysicalNodeMaterial` (transmission,
`dispersion`, sheen, iridescence) and `MeshSSSNodeMaterial` are exercised by
the material packs — recipes and measured traps in `materials.md`,
demonstrated in `examples/materials.html`. `MeshToonNodeMaterial` is available
but deliberately unused: the cel recipe authors its banding directly in the
node graph on `MeshBasicNodeMaterial` instead.
Post chains compose through
`THREE.RenderPipeline` (`PostProcessing` is its deprecated alias). The
template runs one ALWAYS, pass-through by default, with `STYLE.bloom` and
`STYLE.dof` flags — both verified byte-deterministic through smoke on both
backends, and DoF's focus distance rides the cinematography solver's
`shotFocus` through a uniform, making the `SHOTS[]` `focus` property
functional. TSL bloom thresholds are NOT the old `UnrealBloomPass` brackets —
re-measure before trusting any number.

Bundle cost: 1.09 MB embedded per scene (vs 0.77 MB for the old WebGL stack).

## r185 notes carried over

`PCFSoftShadowMap` deprecated (use `PCFShadowMap`); `outputColorSpace`, not
`outputEncoding`; physical lighting is the only mode. `THREE.<removed>` is
`undefined`, not an error — smoke treats console warnings as failures for
exactly this class.
